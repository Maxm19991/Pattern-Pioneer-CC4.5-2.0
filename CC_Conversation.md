## Session 1: Project Initialization & Setup

### Initial Setup
1. **Technology Stack Decision**
   - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript)
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS with pastel color scheme
   - Database: Supabase (Postgres + Storage)
   - Authentication: NextAuth.js v5
   - Payments: Stripe (test mode)
   - State Management: Zustand
   - Hosting: Vercel (free tier)

2. **Project Initialization**
   - Created Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
   - Configured custom pastel color theme
   - Set up project structure and environment variables
   - Created `.env.local.example` for configuration reference

3. **Pattern Assets**
   - Found 113 existing patterns in `Patterns 72DPI/` folder
   - Converted all PNG patterns to WEBP format (30% file size reduction)
   - Generated pattern metadata in `lib/data/patterns.json`

### Database Schema Design
Created comprehensive database schema with tables:
- `users` - User accounts with email and password
- `patterns` - Pattern catalog with pricing and metadata
- `orders` - Purchase records with Stripe integration
- `order_items` - Individual items in each order
- `downloads` - Download access tracking
- `email_subscribers` - Newsletter subscriptions

---

## Session 2: Core Features Implementation

### Homepage Development
**Initial Design:**
- Gradient background with pastel colors
- Hero section with CTA buttons
- Newsletter signup form

**Redesign (per user feedback):**
- Removed gradient and colorful elements
- Clean white background
- Added 6 featured patterns in 2×3 grid
- Minimal design to showcase patterns
- Subtle hover effects (zoom + overlay)

### Pattern Pages
1. **Pattern Grid (`/patterns`)**
   - 3-column responsive grid (1 column on mobile)
   - Pattern cards with image, name, and price
   - Initially static, later connected to Supabase

2. **Pattern Detail Page (`/patterns/[slug]`)**
   - Left side: Live seamless tiling preview
   - Right side: Pattern details, pricing, and actions
   - "Add to Cart" button
   - Email-gated free download form (UI only)
   - License information display
   - Related patterns section (placeholder)

### Shopping Cart
1. **State Management**
   - Implemented Zustand for cart state
   - Persistent cart using localStorage
   - Add/remove items functionality
   - Cart badge showing item count in navigation

2. **Cart Page (`/cart`)**
   - Item list with thumbnails
   - Remove item functionality
   - Order summary with totals
   - Guest checkout support

### Stripe Integration
1. **Initial Setup**
   - Added Stripe test keys to environment
   - Created checkout API endpoint (`/api/checkout`)
   - Integrated Stripe.js on frontend

2. **Checkout Flow**
   - Checkout page with test mode instructions
   - Stripe Checkout session creation
   - Success page with cart clearing
   - **Issue encountered:** Product images required publicly accessible URLs
   - **Solution:** Removed images for localhost testing (will add back in production)

3. **Testing**
   - Successfully tested payment with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Verified redirect to success page
   - Confirmed cart clearing after purchase

---

## Session 3: Database Integration

### Supabase Setup
1. **Account Creation**
   - Created Supabase project: "pattern-pioneer"
   - Obtained project URL and API keys
   - Configured environment variables

2. **Database Schema Execution**
   - Ran SQL schema to create all tables
   - Created indexes for query optimization
   - Added UUID extension for primary keys

3. **Pattern Migration**
   - Created migration script to populate patterns table
   - Converted pattern IDs from strings to UUIDs
   - Successfully migrated all 113 patterns to Supabase

4. **Application Integration**
   - Replaced JSON file reading with Supabase queries
   - Updated `getPatterns()`, `getPatternBySlug()`, `getPatternById()`
   - Verified patterns loading from database

---

## Session 4: Authentication System

### NextAuth.js Implementation
1. **Initial Setup (Email-only)**
   - Installed NextAuth.js v5 (beta)
   - Configured Supabase adapter
   - Created basic credentials provider
   - Auto-created users on first sign-in

2. **Password Authentication (User Request)**
   - Added `password` column to users table
   - Installed and configured bcrypt for password hashing
   - Created separate sign-up and sign-in flows

3. **Sign-Up Page (`/auth/signup`)**
   - Email + password form
   - Password confirmation field
   - Minimum 8 character validation
   - Password match validation
   - API endpoint for user creation with hashed passwords

4. **Sign-In Page (`/auth/signin`)**
   - Email + password form
   - Password verification with bcrypt
   - Error handling for invalid credentials
   - Success message after registration

5. **Password Visibility Toggle (User Request)**
   - Added eye icon buttons to password fields
   - Open eye = password visible
   - Closed eye with slash = password hidden
   - Independent toggles for password and confirm password fields

### Route Protection
1. **Middleware Configuration**
   - Created authentication middleware
   - Protected `/account/*` routes
   - Redirect to sign-in if not authenticated

2. **Account Pages**
   - Account dashboard showing user email
   - Downloads page (placeholder)
   - Orders page (placeholder)
   - Favorites page (placeholder)

3. **Navigation Updates**
   - Dynamic auth button (Sign In vs Account/Sign Out)
   - Session-based UI rendering
   - Proper redirect flows

---

## Session 5: Stripe Webhooks (Current)

### Webhook Implementation
1. **Stripe CLI Setup**
   - Downloaded Stripe CLI for Windows
   - Encountered antivirus false positive (resolved)
   - Successfully installed and logged in
   - Connected to Stripe account (sandbox mode)

2. **Webhook Endpoint Creation**
   - Created `/api/webhooks/stripe` endpoint
   - Implemented signature verification
   - Handler for `checkout.session.completed` event

3. **Webhook Logic**
   When payment succeeds:
   - Verify webhook signature
   - Extract session data (email, amount, items)
   - Check if user exists, create if needed
   - Create order record in database
   - Create order items for each purchased pattern
   - Grant download access in downloads table

4. **Local Testing Setup**
   - Added webhook secret to `.env.local`
   - Started Stripe CLI with forwarding:
     ```
     stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3004/api/webhooks/stripe
     ```
   - Ready to test end-to-end flow

### Current Status: Testing Webhooks
**Waiting for:** User to complete test purchase and verify:
- Order appears in `orders` table
- Order items in `order_items` table
- Download access in `downloads` table
- Stripe CLI shows successful webhook delivery

- Real-time capabilities (future use)
- Good TypeScript support

### Why NextAuth v5?
- Native Next.js 14 support
- JWT session strategy (no database sessions needed)
- Flexible provider system
- Active maintenance

### Why WEBP for Patterns?
- 25-35% smaller file size vs PNG
- Maintains quality
- Faster page loads
- Browser support is excellent

### Why Zustand for Cart?

   - Will be implemented in Phase 2

3. **Port changes**
   - Started on 3000, now on 3004 (due to multiple dev server restarts)
   - Environment variables updated accordingly

4. **Stripe CLI**
   - Webhook secret expires after 90 days
   - Will need to re-authenticate periodically
   - For production, use dashboard webhooks instead

## Cost Optimization Strategy

**Current Monthly Costs:** €0

- **Vercel:** Free tier (hobby projects)
- **Supabase:** Free tier (500MB DB, 1GB storage)
- **Stripe:** 2.9% + €0.30 per transaction only
- **Domain:** ~€10-15/year (when purchased)

**Scaling Plan:**
- Free tier should handle early traffic
- Upgrade Vercel to Pro ($20/mo) if needed for analytics
- Upgrade Supabase to Pro ($25/mo) if storage/DB grows
- Keep fixed costs under €10/month until revenue justifies upgrades
